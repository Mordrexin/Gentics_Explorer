# Configuration for the Plant Genetics Explorer

# --- General App Settings ---
app_title: "ðŸŒ± Plant Genetics Explorer (Configured v2.1)"
app_description: |
  Explore open genetic databases and analyze (mock) gene-trait relationships in plants.
  **Note:** This is a simplified demonstrator using configuration from YAML.
  Sample files generated are saved to the configured data directory.

# --- Data Directory ---
data_directory: "genetic_data_output" # You can change this path

database_options:
  - "NCBI (SRA, GenBank, RefSeq)"
  - "Ensembl Plants"
  - "Phytozome (JGI)"
  - "The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR)" # Example of adding another

# --- Mock Gene Data (can be extensive) ---
# You can move the entire MOCK_GENE_DATA dictionary here.
# For brevity in this example, I'll show a shortened version.
# Ensure the structure matches the Python dictionary.
